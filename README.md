This is the rendering script used for my online game Wish Upon A
Star. Details about the game itself can be
found [on my website](http://mercerenies.sdf.org/wuas/) (mirrored as a
repo [here](https://github.com/Mercerenies/personal-website)). This
repository contains the rendering Python script, as well as a few
example data files.
